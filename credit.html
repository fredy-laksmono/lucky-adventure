    <p>Need to find a way on not chaining the click as got into situation where clicking one thing, it have a chain reaction effect and triggering next click event listener.</p>
    <p>This stop propagation seems work for some case, but found out later, it doesn't work as expected on another case. Might be issue which too much chaining function and click event listener</p>
